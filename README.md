# install-kali-termux
### Custom Kali installation based on the minimal file-system of the official nethunter repositories from Offensive Security, in termux with a rooted device.
### More functions were added than in the script provided by offensive security and I will add more when the time comes.

#### Open termux and paste this code to install kali on it:
```bash
apt update && apt install wget -y
wget -O install_kali https://git.io/JUnAD 
chmod +x install_kali
./install_kali
```

## NEW:
### Support for x86 and AMD64 added; now you can install kali in an Android emulator!
